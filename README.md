# CprE 308 Exam Reference Sheets

Content added here will be attached to the exam for reference.

Students are free to add any information they desire, so long as the output fits on a single page.

I'll be using pandoc to convert the file to a PDF, unless another solution is provided (with a makefile).

For Midterm 2, place all information in the exam2/ folder.  If any other compilation instruction are needed, use a README in that folder.

## Submission
 - Make your changes/additions, and simply submit a pull request.
 - We'll essentially be operating in "Anarchy Mode", so please be courteous.  If you have a comment or concern, feel free to use GitHub's comment feature.
 - If you have an idea but aren't ready to include it, simply create an issue.

## Preview:
After each successful pull request, I'll put the currently generated document here for previewing: http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~bpeck/cpre308/final.pdf

Note: If it goes over one page, only the first page will be used.
